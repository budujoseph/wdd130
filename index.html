            <p> Hello! My name is Joseph Budu Larbi and i am from Accra,Ghana. I enjoy playing basketball and surfing the internet.
                I look forward in gettin a good grade for WDD 130 and be a web developer. Beginning of the course was not easy for
                for me but i am really trying and i see progress each and every day. As an upcoming web developer i should stay consistent 
                and make sure and practice and get the concept being thought.I know that nothing good comes easy so i have to put in work 
                and also rely on God and His son Jesus Christ for help.Saying a prayer any time i am to about study has really helped me a lot
                as the Holy Ghost helps me to remember the things i have learnt.
           </p>

                Although relatively small in area and population, Ghana is one of the leading countries of 
                Africa, partly because of its considerable natural wealth and partly because it was the first 
                black African country south of the Sahara to achieve independence from colonial rule.
